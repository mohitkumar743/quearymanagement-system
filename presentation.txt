### Query Management System (MERN Stack Project)

---

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
- **Title:** Query Management System
- **Subtitle:** A MERN Stack Project for Managing User Queries
- **Presented by:** [Your Name]

---

#### **Slide 2: Introduction**
- **What is a Query Management System?**
  - A web-based application designed to handle user queries efficiently.
  - Allows users to submit their queries and administrators to manage and respond to them.
  - Built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

---

#### **Slide 3: Project Overview**
- **User Perspective:**
  - Users can register and log in.
  - Once logged in, they can submit queries.
  - Users receive responses from the admin directly via email.
  
- **Admin Perspective:**
  - Admins can view and manage all submitted queries.
  - Admins respond to queries, and the system sends an email notification to the user.
  
---

#### **Slide 4: Technology Stack**
- **Frontend: React.js**
  - User interface for submitting and viewing queries.
  - Responsive and dynamic design.
  
- **Backend: Node.js & Express.js**
  - Handles server-side logic and API requests.
  - Manages authentication, query submission, and admin responses.
  
- **Database: MongoDB**
  - Stores user data, queries, and admin responses.
  - NoSQL database, well-suited for handling unstructured data.
  
- **Email Service: NodeMailer**
  - Used to send query responses directly to the user's email.

---

#### **Slide 5: System Architecture**
- **User Interface (React.js):**
  - Users interact with the application through a clean, intuitive interface.
  
- **API Layer (Express.js):**
  - Handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the database.
  
- **Database Layer (MongoDB):**
  - Stores data related to users, queries, and responses.
  
- **Email Notifications (NodeMailer):**
  - Admin responses are sent to users' email addresses.

---

#### **Slide 6: Features**
- **User Registration & Login:**
  - Secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  
- **Query Submission:**
  - Users can submit queries through a simple form.
  - Queries are stored in the database for admin review.
  
- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - Admins can view, filter, and manage user queries.
  
- **Email Response:**
  - Admins can respond to queries, triggering an email notification to the user.

---

#### **Slide 7: User Interface**
- **Screenshots/Demo:**
  - Show the user registration and login page.
  - Display the query submission form.
  - Showcase the admin dashboard and query management interface.

---

#### **Slide 8: Admin Workflow**
- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  1. Admin logs into the system.
  2. Views all submitted queries.
  3. Responds to a query.
  4. System sends an email to the user with the admin's response.

---

#### **Slide 9: Database Schema**
- **User Collection:**
  - Fields: `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`.
  
- **Query Collection:**
  - Fields: `user_id`, `query_text`, `status`, `created_at`, `response`.
  
- **Response Collection:**
  - Fields: `query_id`, `response_text`, `admin_id`, `sent_at`.

---

#### **Slide 10: Security Considerations**
- **Authentication:**
  - Implemented using JWT for secure user sessions.
  
- **Data Validation:**
  - Ensures that all inputs (queries and responses) are properly sanitized.
  
- **Access Control:**
  - Admins have exclusive access to the query management dashboard.

---

#### **Slide 11: Challenges & Solutions**
- **Email Deliverability:**
  - Ensured by using NodeMailer with a reliable SMTP service.
  
- **Efficient Data Handling:**
  - MongoDB used for its flexibility and scalability.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Focused on a simple and intuitive design using React.js.

---

#### **Slide 12: Future Enhancements**
- **Automated Responses:**
  - Implement AI-driven responses for common queries.
  
- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - Provide insights on query trends and response times.
  
- **Multi-Language Support:**
  - Allow users to submit queries in multiple languages.

---

#### **Slide 13: Conclusion**
- **Summary:**
  - The Query Management System streamlines the process of handling user queries.
  - Efficiently connects users with admins, ensuring timely responses.
  
- **Thank You!**
  - Open for any questions or discussions.
